# IT Workshop Laboratory - Python
This repository contains all the programs in **Python** that I had developed as a part of our course curriculum in the **3rd Semester IT Workshop Laboratory**. It has entry-level programs covering all the aspects of the language that can be very useful to a beginner. 

**P.S.** *I was in the learning phase too, during the course. Python was a new language to me back then. Do excuse all the unoptimized methods of looping and accepting input in the first few programs.*
